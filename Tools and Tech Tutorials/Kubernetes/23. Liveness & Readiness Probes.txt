Liveness Probes:
- Used to check if a pod is running.
- If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the pod.

1️⃣ Exec Probes
Use when: You want to run a command inside the container to verify health.
How it works: Kubelet executes the specified command.

---
livenessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  exec:
    command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"]
---

2️⃣ TCP Socket Probes
Use when: Your app listens on a TCP port.
How it works: Kubelet tries to open a TCP connection to the container.

---
livenessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3000
---

3️⃣ HTTP GET Probes
Use when: Your app exposes an HTTP endpoint.
How it works: Kubelet sends an HTTP GET request to the specified path and port.

---
livenessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 80
---
4️⃣ GRPC Probes
Use when: Your app uses gRPC for communication.
How it works: Kubelet sends a gRPC request to the specified service and method.

---
livenessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  grpc:
    port: 50051
    service: myservice
    method: MyMethod
---

Readiness Probes:
- Used to check if a pod is ready to serve traffic.
- If a readiness probe fails, the pod will be removed from the service endpoints.

1️⃣ Exec Probes
Use when: You want to run a command to verify if the app is ready to serve traffic.
How it works: Kubelet executes the command inside the container.

---
readinessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  exec:
    command: ["cat", "/tmp/ready"]
---

2️⃣ TCP Socket Probes
Use when: Your app becomes ready once it starts listening on a TCP port.
How it works: Kubelet tries to establish a TCP connection.

---
readinessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3000
---

3️⃣ HTTP GET Probes
Use when: Your app exposes a ready-check HTTP endpoint.
How it works: Kubelet sends an HTTP GET request to the path and port.

---
readinessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 80
---
4️⃣ GRPC Probes
Use when: Your app uses gRPC and has a method to check readiness.
How it works: Kubelet sends a gRPC request to the specified service and method.

---
readinessProbe:
  periodSeconds: 5
  grpc:
    port: 50051
    service: myservice
    method: MyMethod
